# 📊 E-Commerce Sales Analysis and Optimization  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes e-commerce sales data to optimize demand forecasting, product performance evaluation, and return management. The analysis aims to help businesses enhance operational efficiency, minimize costs, and improve customer satisfaction through data-driven insights.  

## 🏢 Organization Background  
The dataset originates from an online retail store based in the UK, which specializes in selling homeware and gift items globally. The business caters to both individual customers (B2C) and wholesalers (B2B), operating through an e-commerce platform.  

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
The project focuses on four key challenges:  
- **Product/Customer Performance Analysis:** A small percentage of products/customers generate a significant portion of revenue (Pareto principle).  
- **Demand Forecasting:** Unpredictable sales trends lead to inventory management issues.  
- **Return Analysis:** A high volume of product returns impacts profitability, requiring deeper insights.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Understanding customer segments leads to better targeting of differents groups.

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)  
- **Fields:** `InvoiceNo`, `StockCode`, `Description`, `Quantity`, `InvoiceDate`, `UnitPrice`, `CustomerID`, `Country`  
- **Time Span:** December 2010 - December 2011  
- **Total Records:** 500,000+  

## 📌 Methodology  
The following techniques and models are applied for analysis:  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data cleaning, missing value handling, and visualization of key trends.    
2. **Pareto Analysis:** Identifying top-selling products that contribute the most revenue.
3. **Demand Forecasting:** Using Time series analysis and ARIMA models to predict future demand.
4. **Return Analysis:** Examining return patterns and their impact on sales and revenue.  
5. **Customer Segmentation:** Clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) to identify customer behavior patterns.

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels  
- **Deployment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
